# TriathlonEvent class

This work should be done in the TriathlonEvent.swift file that already exists in the project.

The `TriathlonEvent` class implements the functionality necessary to simulate a triathlon race event.

1. The class will implement a constant property named `triathlon` of the type `Triathlon` with no initial value defined.

2. The class will implement an initializer that takes a parameter with the identifier `triathlon` of type `Triathlon` and set the initial value of the `triathlon` property to the value passed as a parameter.

3. The class will implement a variable property named `eventPerformed` of the type `Bool` with the initial value of `false`.  This variable should have public access for reading and private access for writing.  Hint: this is accomplished by adding the `private(set)` keyword before the `var` keyword.

4. The class will implement a method that can be used to register a `Participant` in the event.  This method should be named `register`, and take a single parameter with the empty label `_` of type `Participant`.  The implementation of this method should add this participant to the event and give them an initial time of 0 minutes.  This method should use a guard statement to verify that `eventPerformed` is false and call the `fatalError()` function if that verification fails.  How you store participant data is up to you, you may create whatever additional properties and private methods you like.  It is acceptable to assume that participant names will be unique.

5. The class will implement a computed property named `registeredParticipants` of type `[Participant]` that only specifies a get block which returns an array of all currently registered participants.

6. The class will implement a method that returns the race time for a particular registered participant.  This method should be named `raceTime`, take a single parameter with the label `for` of type `Participant`, and return the type `Int?`.

7. The class will implement a method that simulates one sport of the triathlon for a specific participant with some random variance.  This method should be named `simulate`, take a first parameter with the empty label `_` of type `Sport`, a second parameter with the label `for` of type `Participant`, and a third parameter with the label `randomValue` of type `Double` which has a default value of `Double.random()`.  The if the sport is equal to the participant's favorite sport or the random value is >= 0.05 the implementation should call the `completionTime(for:in:)` method on the participant for the sport and store the result.  This resulting time should then be added to the participants event time (which was initialized to 0 upon registration).  If the sport is not the participant's favorite sport and the random value is < 0.05, the participants event time should be set to nil to indicate they have failed at the sport and dropped out of the race.  This method should use a guard statement to verify that the participant's event time is not already nil, returning if it is.  The method should print the text "<participant name> is about to begin <sport>".  If the participant finishes the sport the method should print the text "<participant name> finished the <sport> event in <time for sport> minutes; their total race time is now <event time> minutes."  If the participant does not finish the sport the method should print the text "<participant name> could not finish the <sport> event and will not finish the race.".

8. The class will implement a method that simulates the entire triathlon event for all registered participants.  This method should be named `simulate` and take no parameters.  The implementation of this method should loop through `Triathlon.sports` and for each sport loop through all registered participants calling the `simulate(_:forParticipant:)` method.  After simulating each participant in each sport, it should set the `eventPerformed` variable to `true`.  This method should use a guard statement to verify that `eventPerformed` is false and call the `fatalError()` function if that verification fails.

9. The class will implement a computed property named `winner` of type `Participant?` that only specifies a get block which determines the winner of the triathlon event based on all the participant event times.  A participant with a nil event time should never win.  If two or more participants are tied with the same winning event time, the one who registered first should win.  It is possible for no participant to win if the event time for all participants is set to nil during `performEvent()`, although this should be extremely rare in practice.  This method should use a guard statement to verify that `eventPerformed` is true and call the `fatalError()` function if that verification fails.

The next page will describe how to [implement the Main.swift file](@next).
