# Runner class

This work should be done in the Runner.swift file that already exists in the project.

The `Runner` class is a subcass of the `Athlete` class that provides a more specific implementation of the `favoriteSport` computed property.

1. The class will override the implementation of the parent `favoriteSport` property by using a computed property that only specifies a get block which returns `Sport.running`.

The next page will describe how to [implement the TriathlonEvent class](@next).
