# Triathlon enum

This work should be done in the Triathlon.swift file that already exists in the project.

The `Triathlon` enum represents the collection of four of the common triathlon distances.  It should contain four different enum cases: `sprint`, `olympic`, `halfIronman`, and `ironman`.

In addition to the cases listed above, the `Triathlon` enum should contain a function named `distance` that takes a single parameter with the label `for` of type `Sport` (the identifier for the parameter is not important, but `sport` would be a good choice) and returns a value of type `Int`.  Based on the value of `self` and the passed parameter value, it should return the number of meters as appropriate based on the following data:
* Sprint distances
	* Swimming: 750 meters
	* Cycling: 20000 meters
	* Running: 5000 meters
* Olympic distances
	* Swimming: 1500 meters
	* Cycling: 40000 meters
	* Running: 10000 meters
* HalfIronman distances
	* Swimming: 1930 meters
	* Cycling: 90000 meters
	* Running: 21090 meters
* Ironman distances
	* Swimming: 3860 meters
	* Cycling: 180000 meters
	* Running: 42200 meters

Hint: You can create a tuple value of `self` and the parameter value (named `sport` in the example below) and use a switch statement like the following:

	switch (self, sport) {
	case (.sprint, .swimming):
		// ...
	// Other cases...
	}

Lastly, you will need to add a static constant named `sports` to the Triathlon enum which will represent the sports that occur during a triathlon and their order.  The value should be an array of `Sport` objects, containing exactly and in this order: `Sport.swimming`, `Sport.cycling`, and `Sport.running`.

Hint: A static constant or variable is a constant or variable that is a part of a type itself, rather than part of each instance of that type.  You declare the constant or variable as normal, except that you add the `static` keyword before the `let` or `var` keyword.

The next page will describe how to [implement the Participant protocol](@next).
